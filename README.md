### Welcome to my Leetcode Repository

This repository contains all the scripts I've written to solve LeetCode challenges.

Each solution was crafted solely by me â€” no external references, no shortcuts. These codes are not necessarily optimized, but they serve as a record of my personal learning journey and growth in problem-solving.

Feel free to explore, learn, or compare approaches.
